# Vue-Python-Flask-Commerce_Stripe

## Hello and welcome to our final project for Sait's Webdev Fast-Track course. This project consists of a complete overhaul/redesign of The Sentry Box's current website. 

- Our goal simply put is to provide users with a more simple modern way to buy/rent games as well as allow the employees of the company have a refined and more cleaner looking interface to more easily increase performance. We also want to allow the consumer to be able to have the best
experience possible.

- This site as it stands contains a full 5 page site that includes a payment system and the ability to add games to a table, and remove them, change the price, name of the game, and the name of the author.
